# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).  This app is suppose to be a dictionary that supports fuzzy searches in the Beja language.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that exports the web build and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

1. In your GitHub repo settings, go to **Pages** and set **Build and deployment** → **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
2. Push to the `main` branch.
3. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` will publish the site at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Local sanity-check (simulates hosting under `/<repo>/`):

```bash
EXPO_BASE_URL=<repo> npm run export:web
GH_PAGES_BASE_PATH=<repo> npm run postprocess:gh-pages
```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
